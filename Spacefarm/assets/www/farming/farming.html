<p> <font color="white"> 2542 AD. Your uncle was one of the first people to buy land in an unknown planet and decided to turn it into a farm to facilitate the earth&#39s growing needs of foods. As years went by the farm became very profitable and produced the most sought out products. You were very surprised when you received a mail saying that your uncle had left you the farm years ago but you only learned of it now. After so many years the fields are unused and empty. Will you be able to salvage the farm? Spend your money wisely to grow the company and unlock new possibilities by doing the exercises.</font> </p>
