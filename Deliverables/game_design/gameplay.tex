\subsection{Game Story}
The game starts with a story to get the user into the game.

\textit{2542 AD. Your uncle was one of the first people to buy land in an unknown planet and decided to turn it into a farm to facilitate the earth's growing needs of food. Your uncle made the farm very profitable and he produced the best products available on earth. You received a mail telling you that your uncle had left you the farm already years ago. The fields on planet Yeo are unused and empty. Are you able to make the farm successful again?}

\subsection{Gameplay}
The user is a novice farmer in the game and is instructed by a virtual physiotherapist, an old farmer called Phil. Phil instructs the user to learn and perform different types of exercises regularly that help to stay healthy in real life. Executing the exercises is also necessary to progress in the game. By cloning crops and livestock the user can become a more skilled farmer and revive the company. 
\\\\
The game mechanics are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gameconcept}. The central point is the exercise, which influences all the progress in the game.

To clone crops or livestock on the farm, the farmer needs sufficient coins to buy them. Coins can be earned by harvesting products or by completing challenges. The user can pay coins to clone the crops or livestock and place them on tiles in the map. In a certain time interval the crops are ripe and can be harvested and livestock products can be gathered. In order to do this, specific exercises are to be executed in real life. 
\\\\
Challenges are separate stories and require the execution of a set of exercises focused on a specific body region or on the full body. Most of the challenges require you to harvest some items before starting them.
\\\\
The farmer is equipped with a Bionic Outer Dimension Yeosuit (B.O.D.Y.) as described in chapter \ref{chap:GamePurpose}. The B.O.D.Y. reflects all the exercises the user has executed. For example, after performing an exercise that focuses on chest muscles, experience points are added to the B.O.D.Y. for the chest. Once the user has enough experience points for each body part, the level of the B.O.D.Y. is increased. This way, the user is informed about which body regions have to be improved and need more focus in the future. An upgrade of the level of the B.O.D.Y. allows the user to clone more products and unlocks new challenges.
\\\\
More details about each of these components will be given in paragraph~\ref{subsec:GameFeatures}.

\subsection{Example game scenario}
This section provides an example of the game play. In this example, the user clones a space apple tree with his money and plants it on any available tile on the map. After a few hours the apples can be harvested, additionally the user can request for a notification to be informed. To harvest the apples, the user has to execute an exercise for picking apples. The mentor gives a description of the exercise in detail and also show how to execute the exercise properly for the users less interested in reading the description. Once the apples are harvested, the user receives the corresponding reward in coins and the harvested space apples are added to the inventory. These space apples might be used to start new challenges or feed the Piggiums, the cloned pigs that are exported to space.
