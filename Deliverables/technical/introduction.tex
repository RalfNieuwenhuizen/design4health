Nowadays, people are getting more and more stuck behind their desks or on the couch, which is the cause for many diseases. Physiofun is a mobile phone game designed to encourage the users to exercise regularly. The user will try to develop a farm in space, by completing real life exercises.\\

The idea for the application originated from the project specifications set to us by Design4Health, a company that aims to ``apply user-centered design tools and methods to the field of healthcare. Through a careful study of digital touch-points, behavioral science and a combination of digital and physical products to shape a new and better healthcare experience.''\\

The report will start off explaining the various design decisions we have made, and why we have made them. After that, the technologies used will be explained, followed by the game structure along with all the components in the game. Next there will be a part about the user interface, followed by a section about the sensors used to measure the exercises. The report will conclude with challenges we had during the development, and technical recommendations towards a real serious game, which is ready for the market, you can regard this as a ``wishlist''.
