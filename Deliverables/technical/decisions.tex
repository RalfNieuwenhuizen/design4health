This section provides more insight to our main choices for the project and our decision making process.
\\\\
One of the first things we had to think about was a way to incorporate our software with sensors since it was one of the goals of our project. 
\\\\
At the very start of the project we to make a decision if we would make the game for a computer or for a mobile device. Clearly we chose for a mobile game, the reason is that the devices already have incorporated sensors we want to use. Another decision we had to make is if our game would be played in iOS devices, Android devices or Windows phone. We decided to use the Phonegap framework since it would allow as to make the application available to all the above operating systems. 
\\\\
Another reason we chose for PhoneGap was that it seemed to be the most convenient way to develop an Android game. Most of us had more knowledge of web languages and less of other languages. PhoneGap seemed an easy tool to convert web pages to a native Android app. 
\\\\
Another decision was about the way to develop the graphics. Who chose not to use for 3D graphics with for example Blender because of the time and size constraints as it would make the size of the application much larger. It also would take much longer to design them. Instead we opted for 2D graphics and isometric tiles that would give our application the illusion of a third dimension.
